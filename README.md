# Bayesian Dynamic Borrowing Project Repository

## Project Description

Our collaborative project with Procter & Gamble (P&G) explores the application of Bayesian Dynamic Borrowing (BDB) methodologies to optimize Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) in oral care and face cream datasets using historical data integration. The primary aim is to reduce sample size requirements for control groups while maintaining statistical rigor. We focus on developing adaptive strategies that incorporate historical data into current trials, thereby enhancing efficiency and accelerating decision-making in clinical studies.

We evaluate various BDB techniques such as power priors, commensurate priors, Elastic Priors, Bayesian hierarchical models, and meta-analytic-predictive priors. Through simulations and analysis, we assess these methodsâ€™ performance in oral care and face cream datasets, particularly examining bias, variance, and statistical power across different scenarios of treatment and historical data alignment.

Initial findings suggest that methods like the power prior and commensurate prior effectively control bias, while the Elastic Prior provides a balanced approach considering bias, variance, and computational efficiency, especially in scenarios of partial congruence between historical and current trial data.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies through sample analyses, such as varying the means of treatment and control groups, and historical versus control groups, exploring the impact of individual noise, and assessing how historical data influences treatment distributions in a Round-robin model. This research not only highlights the practical advantages of advanced Bayesian techniques in oral care and cosmetic product trials but also contributes to advancing statistical methodology in clinical trial design and analysis.
